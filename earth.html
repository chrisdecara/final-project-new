                <p>Earth. What is there to say about Earth? Frankly, I'm quite surprised that half the other species in the solar system haven't tried completely destroying the planet and starting from scratch yet. Perhaps they think that it just isn't that worth it. I would personally agree.</p>
                <p>Still, I suppose the Earthlings on the planet have done <em>some</em> interesting things down there. In fact, I've popped in from time to time to take a look at their puny world, much like a person pops in to visit unpleasant relatives just to pet their dogs. Or pet schlemplocks. If you're wondering, those are native to my planet.</p>
                <p>Peruse the map below to see some of my favorite sights on the planet.</p>
